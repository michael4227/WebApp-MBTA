# WebApp-MBTA
 This is the base repo for MBTA project. Please read [instructions](instructions.md). 


Project Overview
	This project – MBTA Helper creates a website to help users determine the nearest MBTA stop and if the stop is wheelchair boarding accessible. Users input a destination on the website and will receive the nearest MBTA stop. If there is no nearest MBTA stop, the website will tell the users that there is an error and ask the users to re-enter another location. The project includes extensions front style and text align center. 

Project Reflection
	We did well on the programming part.  We successfully wrote the code to get API keys, find the nearest MBTA station given latitude and longitude strings, and whether it is wheelchair accessible. Using Flask to write the website is challenging as it took us more time to get through. 
	We struggled with the push and pull process on Github. In the beginning, we tried to create different branches for individual team members. Then we ran into trouble merging our code and seeing each other’s progress. After consulting with professor, we re-created one repository and put our code in the new repository. 
	Our team worked on programming individually at first. Then we met in person at one of our team members’ place and worked on it together.
